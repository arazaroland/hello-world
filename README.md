# hello-world
# Github is amazing!

Hi, robots!

I am Roland, and I am a newly liscensed engineer. I got in a cadetship program in the largest electrical distribution company in my country, and after my graduation as a cadet I chose this data science job. My passion is into programming since I have experienced programming in few of my classes in college and I fell in love with it (I have fallen in love with computer since I was a kid, a little bit late to learn how to make the machine do what I want.)
In my job, I am dealing with big data, and I am introduced to R and VBA (excel macro) I am enjoying it.

I hope I will do great in this field, I hope that my foundation as an electrical engineer will help me to grow as a data scientist.


Regards,
Roland
